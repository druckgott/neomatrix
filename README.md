Example for NeoMatrix Library | Adafruit NeoPixel Ãœberguide | Adafruit Learning | own Image | running Mario | Arduino

I have generated a Excel File (Macro) where you can generate Images for the neo matrix Arduino Libary if you use the function display_rgbBitmap

You can import pictues which have the same pixel size as your matrix led.

I did not find a easy way how to generate own pictures in a fast way. Now I can generate a picture with some klicks.

In the Example you will se a animation form a running Mario.

The Main things about the NeoMatrix you can finde here:
